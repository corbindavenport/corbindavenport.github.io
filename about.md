# About Me ðŸ““

I'm a tech journalist, independent software developer, and podcaster living in Raleigh, North Carolina. I currently work for [How-To Geek](https://www.howtogeek.com/author/corbindavenport/) as News Editor, host the [Tech Tales podcast](https://techtalesshow.com), and maintain over a dozen open-source web apps, browser extensions, and utilities.

I previously worked as a writer at XDA Developers, PC Gamer, and Android Police. I also made a Minecraft blog years ago called Powered by Redstone and Redstone Central.
