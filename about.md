I'm Corbin Davenport (he/him), a tech writer, software developer, and podcaster living in Raleigh, North Carolina. I currently work for [How-To Geek](https://www.howtogeek.com/author/corbindavenport/) as News Editor, and previously was at XDA Developers, PC Gamer, and Android Police. That has included news coverage, hundreds of guides and tutorials, [over 100 product reviews](/reviews), and editorials.


I also created the [Tech Tales podcast](https://techtalesshow.com) and [Spacebar](https://www.spacebar.news/#/portal/signup) blog, in addition some open-source web apps, browser extensions, and utilities. I also made a Minecraft blog years ago called Powered by Redstone and Redstone Central.
