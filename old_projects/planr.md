# Planr has been discontinued

Planr is no longer supported. It may have security vulnerabilities or compatibility issues in modern web browsers, but the code is [still available on GitHub](https://github.com/corbindavenport/planr).

You can [download the latest version](https://github.com/corbindavenport/planr/releases/latest) for running locally, just open the **index.html** file in the zip archive with a web browser. You should switch to a different app, though.
